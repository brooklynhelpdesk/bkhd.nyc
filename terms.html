          Conditions, or any provisions hereof, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise at law or in equity for damages

          Arbitration Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration
          Association, or a

          This
          arbitration provision shall survive the termination of these Terms and Conditions.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <p>
        <h2>Class Action Waiver</h2>

        <p>Any arbitration under these Terms and Conditions will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations
          and
          class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT A PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS

          OTHER ONLY IN EACH'S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS,
          COLLECTIVE AND/
          OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, SUCH AS IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER.
          Further,
