        <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
        </p>
        <p>The Brooklyn Helpdesk, Inc. website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A
          cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run
          programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a
          web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
        <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a
          cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize
          Brooklyn Helpdesk, Inc. pages, or register with Brooklyn Helpdesk, Inc. site or services, a cookie helps
          Brooklyn Helpdesk, Inc. to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process
          of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you
          return to the same Brooklyn Helpdesk, Inc. website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved,
          so you can easily use the Brooklyn Helpdesk, Inc. features that you customized.</p>
        <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you
          can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies,
          you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Brooklyn Helpdesk, Inc. services or
          websites you visit.</p>

        <p>We strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or alteration of
          your personal information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can
